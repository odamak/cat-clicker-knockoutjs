Cat clicker knockout Js app
============================

App developed with knockout Js  
With this app you can:  
1- Select a cat from the list 
2- You now have name, level, photo, number of clicks of photo and nickname of selected cat all displayed   
3- Click on the photo of the cat to increment number of clicks  
4- When number of clicks is incremented, cat level is changed accordingly  
5- When you switch from cat to cat, data is not lost  
We used js to develop the app.js file and knockout to do the binding in the index.html file
We used "with" and "foreach" bindings.  
"Self" is used in the js file to keep using "this" of the parent.
